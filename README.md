# SDL

## C is not only a programming language, but also a programming puzzle!!

## Notices:

1. You can achieve object oriented programming in C!
2. C is always way faster than C++, when it comes to frames per second!
 I noticed this after running the same program in C and C++ while measuring frame per second.
